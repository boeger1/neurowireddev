                I finished my degree in Computer Science in January 2025, and I am looking for a new challenge. I love to create things and help people when it comes to coding. I don’t see it as just work or something to be done.
                When it comes to programming, it’s not just something I come up with to see if I can make it. It doesn’t matter if it’s an app, a website, or a game—they all share a goal, which is to help people.
                <br></br>
                And you might think, "What do you mean?" They all help in different ways.
                An app can be as simple as a calendar—but not just any calendar, the perfect one. And "perfect" isn’t the same for everyone; that’s why there are so many out there.
                A website can help a small company reach more people and make it easier for them to get new customers. And games—there are so many genres, something for everyone, and all of them exist to entertain or teach.
                <br></br>
                I am not just a programmer; I’m a creator, and I am here to help people.

                I’m always striving to improve and love learning new things. This passion is reflected in my hobbies, free time, and work. Here are some of the projects I've been working on.
