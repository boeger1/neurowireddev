                Hallo world  and welcome to my site My name is Matias, I am twenty-nine years old and live in Denmark, a lovely country with a few days of sunny weather.
                I have been living here all my life and moved around quite a bit. for now, I am located in Roskilde with my lovely girlfriend.
                <br></br>
                You might think, "Yeah, that’s all fine, but that doesn't tell me much about you," and you're right. Well, let's see… I love to build things.
                I have always been creative, but not in the "I like to paint things" way—rather, I love building things myself.I am used to making things out of wood, and I think that’s where my interest in programming comes from It’s just building things in another way.
                <br></br>
                One of my big hobbies is gaming, where MMORPGs are my go-to. I love the big fantasy worlds, and I am amazed by other people's imagination and how they are able to create such magnificent worlds.
                I hope to be a part of that one day.

            <p class="section-description">
                I finished my degree in Computer Science in January 2025, and I am looking for a new challenge. I love to create things and help people when it comes to coding. I don’t see it as just work or something to be done.
                When it comes to programming, it’s not just something I come up with to see if I can make it. It doesn’t matter if it’s an app, a website, or a game—they all share a goal, which is to help people.
                <br></br>
                And you might think, "What do you mean?" They all help in different ways.
                An app can be as simple as a calendar—but not just any calendar, the perfect one. And "perfect" isn’t the same for everyone; that’s why there are so many out there.
                A website can help a small company reach more people and make it easier for them to get new customers. And games—there are so many genres, something for everyone, and all of them exist to entertain or teach.
                <br></br>
                I am not just a programmer; I’m a creator, and I am here to help people.
