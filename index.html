            <p class="section-description">
                I am a newly graduated computer scientist with a strong passion for software development and technological solutions that make a difference. 
                Through my education at Zealand Academy of Technologies and Business, I have built strong skills in programming, system development, and business understanding. 
                I have worked with technologies such as C#, C++, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and database systems.
                I thrive in a dynamic development environment where collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement are key.
                I have a structured and analytical approach to development and am committed to writing clean and maintainable code. 
                Additionally, I have a keen interest in automation and system optimization, where I can contribute to improving processes and creating efficient digital solutions.
                I am seeking new challenges in software development where I can apply my skills and continue to learn. If you have an exciting opportunity, feel free to get in touch!</p>
